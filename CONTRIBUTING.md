# Submitting Amendments

Before submitting any change to the list, please make sure to read the [Guidelines](https://github.com/publicsuffix/list/wiki/Guidelines).

A properly formatted and validated patch will decrease the review time, and increase the chances your request will be reviewed and perhaps accepted. Any patch that doesn't follow the Guidelines will be rejected or, in the best scenario, left pending for follow-up.

Common mistakes that may cause the request to be rejected include:

- Invalid patch formatting, rule sorting or changeset position
- Missing validation records
- Lack of proper domain ownership

Make sure to review with the Guidelines before you open a new pull request.

Please also note that there is no guarantee of inclusion, nor we are able to provide an ETA for any inclusion request.
