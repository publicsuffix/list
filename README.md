The Public Suffix List
======================

A "public suffix" is one under which Internet users can (or historically could)
directly register names. Some examples of public suffixes are .com, .co.uk and
pvt.k12.ma.us. The Public Suffix List is a list of all known public suffixes.

See https://publicsuffix.org/ and the [Wiki](https://github.com/publicsuffix/list/wiki) link above for more information.

## Are you here to add or update something?

All submissions must conform to the [validation and acceptance factors](https://github.com/publicsuffix/list/wiki/Guidelines#validation-and-non-acceptance-factors) and provide sufficient rationale or basically be as complete as possible, and follow the [Guidelines](https://github.com/publicsuffix/list/wiki/Guidelines), especially as they relate to format and [sorting](https://github.com/publicsuffix/list/wiki/Guidelines#sort-your-submission-correctly-important).

The list is currently maintained by people who are volunteering their time towards universal acceptance and ensuring there is a bridge between the ICANN world of domain names and the crucial last mile - the world of developers and human users.  

Iteration back and forth will delay PR review or inclusion.  Be extremely thorough, and patient.

## Important Notice

2024-07-26 : We are sending e-mail asking for confirmation if certain entries are still required

Currently, this process is purely manual and extremely low volume but if you do get an e-mail, please respond.

Work with Google Adsense [Help Link](https://support.google.com/adsense/gethelp) with any support questions you have.  The PSL is thinly resourced, and the volunteer maintainers are unable to answer questions about Adsense changes or support Adsense.

The PSL is volunteer-resourced and is absolutely not resourced to answer questions or support changes.  Guidance is in the form of self-help (READ THE [WIKI](https://github.com/publicsuffix/list/wiki)), THERE IS NO PSL CUSTOMER SERVICE RESOURCE TO ASSIST YOU.   *Please work directly with Google to ensure your domain does in fact need an entry, and they should help you know what the benefits and consequences are.  _IT POSSIBLE TO HARM YOUR WEBSITE COOKIES BY REQUESTING A MAL-FORMED PSL ENTRY_.  Also, understand what propagation delays and rollback processing entail before making requests.*

2021-04-23 : Did guidance related to an issue with Facebook or Apple bring you here?  [Read this before submitting requests](https://github.com/publicsuffix/list/issues/1245)  We are not approving workaround requests per the validation and acceptance standards, but do have open discussion with Facebook on the matter.  

## Email Communication Policy

The Public Suffix List (PSL) team conducts periodic reviews to verify the continued necessity of existing entries. As part of this process, we send confirmation emails to entry requestors. While this verification process is currently manual and low-volume, your timely response to any such communication is important for maintaining the list's accuracy.

We recognize that having your email address listed in the PSL may lead to unwanted spam. To help you identify and properly filter legitimate PSL-related communications, starting December 2024, all outreach from PSL contributors and maintainers will follow these standardized practices:

1. **Subject Line Format**: All communications from the project use the subject line prefix `[PSL notification]`, allowing straightforward email filtering rules for spam prevention.  

2. **Reference Links**: Every communication includes a relevant GitHub issue or pull request link (`https://github.com/publicsuffix/list/*`). This serves two purposes:  
   - Verifies message authenticity  
   - Directs responses to our preferred communication channel, as requestors are encouraged to submit changes and responses directly through GitHub rather than email  

3. **Transparency**: To provide a referenceable record, communications CC the [psl-discuss mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/publicsuffix-discuss) or one of the maintainers whenever necessary.
