 Each domain listed in the PRIVATE section has and shall maintain at least two years remaining on registration, and we shall keep the _psl TXT record in place in the respective zone(s).

Submitter affirms the following:

 We are listing any third-party limits that we seek to work around in our rationale such as those between IOS 14.5+ and Facebook (see Issue #1245 as a well-documented example)
 This request was not submitted with the objective of working around other third-party limits.
 The submitter acknowledges that it is their responsibility to maintain the domains within their section. This includes removing names which are no longer used, retaining the _psl DNS entry, and responding to e-mails to the supplied address. Failure to maintain entries may result in removal of individual entries or the entire section.
 The Guidelines were carefully read and understood, and this request conforms to them.

For PRIVATE section requests that are submitting entries for domains that match their organization website's primary domain, please understand that this can have impacts that may not match the desired outcome and take a long time to rollback, if at all.

To ensure that requested changes are entirely intentional, make sure that you read the affectation and propagation expectations, that you understand them, and confirm this understanding.

PR Rollbacks have lower priority, and the volunteers are unable to control when or if browsers or other parties using the PSL will refresh or update.

 Yes, I understand. I could break my organization's website cookies and cause other issues, and the rollback timing is acceptable. Proceed anyways.
Description of Organization
My organization is helping people going online easier. The biggest problem to start is that people don't want to spend money on buying domain. We provide free forever subdomain.

Organization Website: https://bingbook.cn

Reason for PSL Inclusion
The reason is that many users want to have their subdomain as good as a top level domain. This is including the cookie security issue. Some of the laravel apps are using cookie for authentication. And it's accesible from other subdomain.

Number of users this request is being made to serve: we have +- 4500 users and is still growing up
